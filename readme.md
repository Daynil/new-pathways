Static page builder for New Pathways LLC.

Data is sourced from the client via a Wordpress admin backend. This data is
then built into a static page via a simple, zero dependency Python build script.

Run dev build with file watch with `$ ./build-start`. Works well with the
Live Server vscode extension, but can serve `public` directory using any server.
